	    <h3>Wizard Duel is a 2 player fighting game where you shoot fireballs to defeat your opponent. In a realm where power and precision entwine, two warriors stand, locked in an eternal dance of flame and fury. Their weapons—mighty fireballs—borne from the very heart of creation, are hurled with relentless force, yet the path they seek is not one of ease. 
		Before them, an ever-changing labyrinth of obstacles rises, a tempestuous sea of stone and shadow that bends and twists with every move. Each strike is a gamble, each arc of flame a challenge to fate.</h3>
